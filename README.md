# Homer-3D-Blender
This is 3D fan art of Homer Simpson made by Brenden Hyde in Blender `2.91`.
It's based on the [Treehouse of Horror VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VI) segment `HomerÂ³`.

The character is rigged with IK in the legs and FK in the torso and arms.
All bones labeled `CTRL-*` are for animating the character.

Open a GitHub issue if you have any questions about the setup.
I probably won't make any changes, but I might be able to help you.
Enjoy!
